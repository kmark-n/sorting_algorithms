Sorting algorithms - Algorithms that put elements of a list in order.
The output normally satisfies two conditions which are:
1. monotonic order meaning each element is no longer smaller/larger than the previous element.
2. The output is a permutation of the input - rearranging and reordering yet retaining all of the original elements.
The various types include "Bubble sort", "Insertion sort", "Selection sort", "Quick sort"...

The Big O notation describes the worst case scenario or the upper bound of an algorithm's performance. It provides a useful way to compare and ananlyze algorithms based on their scalability and efficiency.
